The impact

Listening to stakeholders, globalisation
What sets us apart from our competition is the impact that we have already created in the lives of over 10,000+ colleagues and also the potential impact that we can create in the entire 85K+ colleagues. The impact can be classified into Qualitative and Quantitative parts 
Qualitative impact -  In the words of our group chief executive and I quote Bill here “We must continue to live out our purpose as a Bank and set out long-term ambitions to make a positive impact, especially when it comes to addressing some of the most critical issues that impact everyone and the planet, including climate change, stark inequality and unfair aspects of globalisation.” The Equilibrium game brings to life the Bold Stands of the Bank and enables them to live and breathe the leadership agreement. The game enables participant to realise that though the Bank is set up to be a profit enterprise for its shareholders, yet it also recognises through our Bold stands our sustainability aspiration and our commitment to sustainable finance. It needs to be both financially sustainable and profitable but also sustainable or value creating for other stakeholders including us, our employees, investors, our clients, our regulators and governments and also our communities in which we operate. We have taken a lot of feedback from the colleagues and this is what they have to say:-
1)	As Oni Yetunde, CEO, Sierra Leone says, the game offers a safe playground to experiment with various choices and feel the impact without grave consequences
2)	One of our colleagues said that she was so overwhelmed with the game as if she has to shoulder so much responsibilities and take decisions in short amount of time – it was an eye opener for her.
3)	Participants have said that they were forced to look at people and planet aspects while taking decisions which they normally ignore
4)	Cross – geographical collaboration 
5)	One senior leader from CPBB has said that it has created a 180 degree transformation in the way he takes decisions at the workplace, helping him realise the value of sustainable decisions which is a win-win for our employees, investors, our clients, our regulators and governments and also our communities in which we operate.
Level 1 & 4 of the game focusses on Resetting Globalisation, Level 2 works on Lifting participation and Level 3 on Accelerating Zero

Quantitative Impact – We have so far run more than 40 leadership initiatives with the Leadership Teams, Top Talents, our Graduates etc and in the pipeline are 15 more such initiatives. The appetite for such a simulation is huge and there is a huge demand to include this in all the developmental initiatives.Over 50 MDs have played the game including 1 GMT, and more than 6 CEOs and many more CXOs of different countries.
